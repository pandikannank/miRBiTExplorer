Please run all the codes in the sequence.
01_Packages.R contains all the necessary R libraries that needs to be loaded to perform the analysis. These packages can be downloaded from https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html or Bioconductor https://www.bioconductor.org/
02_Train.R contains the code to reproduce the pre-processing of Training Data and single-sample classifier training. Fig-2A,2C,2D,2E,2F,2G,2H,3A,3B,3D,3E can be generate with the code.
03_Test.R contains the code to reproduce the pre-processing of Test Data and the classifier performance. Fig-4A,4B,4C,4D,4E can be generated with this code.
04_Validation.R contains the code to reproduce the reproduce the pre-processing of Validation Data and the classifier performance. Fig-5A,5B,5D,5F,5H can be generated with this code.
05_Benign_as_cancer.R contains the code to reproduce the analysis when benign is considered cancer/benign class and comparisons between cancer and cancer/benign groups. Fig-6A,6B,6C,6D,6E,6F,6G,6H can be generated with this code.
Fig.1, Fig.2B, Fig. 3C, Fig. 5C, Fig.5E, Fig.5G are schematics or made with simple tools and hence their codes are not applicable to be present here.

All the analysis was performed in R 4.4.2 and in a workstation with Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS environment and physical RAM memory with a maximum of 256 Gb in a i9 processor.
